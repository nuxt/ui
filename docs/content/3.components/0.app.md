## Usage

This component implements Radix Vue [ConfigProvider](https://www.radix-vue.com/utilities/config-provider.html) to provide global configuration to all components:

- Enables all primitives to inherit global reading direction.
- Enables changing the behavior of scroll body when setting body lock.
- Much more controls to prevent layout shifts.

It's also using [ToastProvider](https://www.radix-vue.com/components/toast.html#provider) and [TooltipProvider](https://www.radix-vue.com/components/tooltip.html#provider) to provide global toasts and tooltips, as well as programmatic modals and slideovers.

Use it as at the root of your app:

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <UApp>
    <NuxtPage />
  </UApp>
</template>
```
