## Usage

The Link component is a wrapper around [`<NuxtLink>`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-link) through the [`custom`](https://router.vuejs.org/api/interfaces/RouterLinkProps.html#Properties-custom) prop that provides a few extra props:

- `inactive-class` prop to set a class when the link is inactive, `active-class` is used when active.
- `exact` prop to style with `active-class` when the link is active and the route is exactly the same as the current route.
- `exact-query` and `exact-hash` props to style with `active-class` when the link is active and the query or hash is exactly the same as the current query or hash.

The incentive behind this is to provide the same API as NuxtLink back in Nuxt 2 / Vue 2. You can read more about it in the Vue Router [migration from Vue 2](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/migration/#removal-of-the-exact-prop-in-router-link) guide.

It also renders an `<a>` tag when a `to` prop is provided, otherwise it renders a `<button>` tag.

It is used underneath by the [Button](/elements/button), [Dropdown](/elements/dropdown) and [VerticalNavigation](/navigation/vertical-navigation) components.
