---

We're thrilled to introduce this major update to our UI library, bringing significant improvements and powerful new features. Nuxt UI v3 represents a leap forward in creating robust, accessible, and highly customizable user interfaces for Nuxt applications.

## What's New in v3?

### Radix Vue

We've transitioned from [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) to [Radix Vue](https://www.radix-vue.com/) as our core component foundation. This shift brings several key advantages:

- **Extensive Component Library**: With 55+ primitives, Radix Vue significantly expands our component offerings.
- **Active Development**: Radix Vue's growing popularity ensures ongoing improvements and updates.
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility features align with our commitment to inclusive design.
- **Vue 3 Optimization**: Seamless integration with Vue 3 and the Composition API.

This transition empowers Nuxt UI to become a more comprehensive and flexible UI library, offering developers greater power and customization options.

### Tailwind CSS v4

Nuxt UI v3 integrates the latest Tailwind CSS v4 alpha (announced March 6, 2024), bringing significant improvements:

- **Faster Builds**: Up to 10x faster, especially for larger projects.
- **Unified Toolchain**: Built-in features like vendor prefixing, nesting support, and modern CSS transforms.
- **CSS-First Configuration**: New `@theme` directive for easy customization without JavaScript.
- **Optimized Performance**: Smaller engine footprint and more efficient processing.

### Tailwind Variants

We've adopted [Tailwind Variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/) to manage our design system, offering:

- **Dynamic Styling**: Flexible component variants with a powerful API
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with auto-completion
- **Conflict Resolution**: Efficient merging of conflicting styles

This integration unifies the styling of components, ensuring consistency and code maintainability.

### TypeScript Integration

Nuxt UI v3 offers significantly improved TypeScript integration, providing a superior developer experience:

- **Enhanced Auto-completion**:
  - Full auto-completion for component props based on your theme
  - Intelligent suggestions for `app.config.ts` theme configuration

- **Generic-based Components**:
  - Built using [Vue 3 Generics](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#generics)
  - Improved type inference for slots and events

- **Type-safe Theming**:
  - Leveraging Tailwind Variants for type-safe styling options
  - Customizable types for extended theme configurations

## Migration

We want to be transparent: migrating from Nuxt UI v2 to v3 will require significant effort. While we've maintained core concepts and components, Nuxt UI v3 has been rebuilt from the ground up, resulting in a new library with enhanced capabilities.

Key points to consider:
- A comprehensive migration guide will be available in the coming weeks.
- Review the new documentation and components carefully before attempting to upgrade.
- If you encounter any issues, please report them on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/issues).

## FAQ

::accordion
  ::accordion-item{label="What are the main considerations when upgrading to Nuxt UI v3?"}
  The transition to v3 involves significant changes, including new component structures, updated theming approaches, and revised TypeScript definitions. We recommend a careful, incremental upgrade process, starting with thorough testing in a development environment.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Will Nuxt UI v3 work with other CSS frameworks like UnoCSS?"}
  Nuxt UI v3 is currently designed to work exclusively with Tailwind CSS. While there's interest in UnoCSS support, implementing it would require significant changes to the theme structure due to differences in class naming conventions. As a result, we don't have plans to add UnoCSS support in v3.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Is Nuxt UI v3 compatible with standalone Vue projects?"}
  We're planning to add Vue support in the near future. For now, Nuxt UI v3 is only available for Nuxt. Track progress on Vue compatibility [in this issue](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/issues/2129).
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Is this version stable and suitable for production use?"}
  As Nuxt UI v3 is currently in alpha, we recommend thorough testing before using it in production environments. We're actively working on stabilization and welcome feedback from early adopters to improve the library. Feel free to report any issues you encounter on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/issues).
