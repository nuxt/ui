---

We're thrilled to introduce this major update to our UI library, bringing significant improvements and powerful new features. Nuxt UI v3 represents a leap forward in creating robust, accessible, and highly customizable user interfaces for Nuxt applications.

## What's New in v3?

### Radix Vue

We've transitioned from [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) to [Radix Vue](https://www.radix-vue.com/) as our core component foundation. This shift brings several key advantages:

- **Extensive Component Library**: With 55+ primitives, Radix Vue significantly expands our component offerings.
- **Active Development**: Radix Vue's growing popularity ensures ongoing improvements and updates.
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility features align with our commitment to inclusive design.
- **Vue 3 Optimization**: Seamless integration with Vue 3 and the Composition API.
- **Performance Boost**: Radix Vue's performance-focused design improves overall application efficiency.

This transition empowers Nuxt UI to become a more comprehensive and flexible UI library, offering developers greater power and customization options.

### Tailwind CSS v4

Nuxt UI v3 integrates the latest Tailwind CSS v4 alpha (announced March 6, 2024), bringing significant improvements:

- **Faster Builds**: Up to 10-20x faster, especially for larger projects.
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Improved error messages and smarter autocomplete.
- **Advanced Styling**: Native color functions, extended animations, and flexible custom properties.
- **Optimized Performance**: Smaller CSS output and more efficient style application.

::caution
Tailwind CSS v4 is currently in alpha. While it offers exciting new features for Nuxt UI v3, we strongly recommend thorough testing in development environments before considering production use.

### Tailwind Variants

We've adopted [Tailwind Variants](https://github.com/nextui-org/tailwind-variants) to manage our design system, offering:

- **Dynamic Styling**: Create flexible component styles and enhance customization while maintaining consistency.
- **Performance and TypeScript**: Optimize style generation with minimal overhead and improve development with full TypeScript support.
- **Responsive Design**: Simplify creation of adaptive components and combine conditions for complex variations.

This integration streamlines development, enhances flexibility, improves maintainability, and boosts overall performance in Nuxt UI v3.

## Migration

We want to be transparent: migrating from Nuxt UI v2 to v3 will require significant effort. While we've maintained core concepts and components, Nuxt UI v3 has been rebuilt from the ground up, resulting in a new library with enhanced capabilities.

Key points to consider:
- A comprehensive migration guide will be available in the coming weeks.
- Review the new documentation and components carefully before attempting to upgrade.
- If you encounter any issues, please report them on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/issues).

## Frequently Asked Questions

::accordion
  ::accordion-item{label="What are the main compatibility challenges when upgrading to Nuxt UI v3?"}
  The transition to Radix Vue and other significant changes limit direct compatibility between v2 and v3. Major differences include:

  - New component structure and APIs
  - Changes in theming and customization approaches
  - Updated TypeScript definitions and prop types

  We recommend a careful, incremental approach to upgrading, starting with thorough testing in a development environment.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Will Nuxt UI v3 work with other CSS frameworks like UnoCSS?"}
  Nuxt UI v3 is currently designed to work exclusively with Tailwind CSS. While there's interest in UnoCSS support, implementing it would require significant changes to the theme structure due to differences in class naming conventions. As a result, we don't have plans to add UnoCSS support in v3.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Is Nuxt UI v3 compatible with standalone Vue projects?"}
  We're planning to add Vue support in the near future. For now, Nuxt UI v3 is only available for Nuxt projects. Track progress on Vue compatibility [in this issue](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/issues/2129).
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Is this version stable and suitable for production use?"}
  As Nuxt UI v3 is currently in alpha, we recommend thorough testing before using it in production environments. We're actively working on stabilization and welcome feedback from early adopters to improve the library. Feel free to report any issues you encounter on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/issues).
