Nuxt UI thrives thanks to its incredible community ❤️. We welcome all contributions through bug reports, pull requests, and feedback to help make this library even better.

::caution
Before reporting a bug or requesting a feature, make sure that you have read through our [documentation](https://ui3.nuxt.dev/) and existing [issues](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20sort%3Aupdated-desc%20label%3Av3).

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the key directories and files in the Nuxt UI project structure:

### Documentation

The documentation lives in the `docs` folder as a Nuxt app using `@nuxt/content` v3 to generate pages from Markdown files. See the [Content v3 Docs](https://content3.nuxt.dev/docs/getting-started) for details on how it works. Here's a breakdown of its structure:

```bash
├── app/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── content/
│   │       └── examples   # Components used in documentation as examples
│   ├── composables/
│   └── ...
├── content/
│   ├── 1.getting-started
│   ├── 2.composables
│   └── 3.components       # Components documentation
```

### Module

The module code resides in the `src` folder. Here's a breakdown of its structure:

```bash
├── devtools/
├── plugins/
├── runtime/
│   ├── components/        # Where all the components are located
│   │   ├── Accordion.vue
│   │   ├── Alert.vue
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── composables/
│   ├── locale/
│   ├── plugins/
│   ├── types/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── vue/
│       ├── components/
│       └── plugins/
├── theme/                 # This where the theme for each component is located
│   ├── accordion.ts       # Theme for Accordion component
│   ├── alert.ts
│   └── ...
└── module.ts
```

## CLI

To make development easier, we've created a CLI that you can use to generate components and locales. You can access it using the `nuxt-ui make` command.

First, you need to link the CLI to your global environment:

```sh
npm link
```

### Components

You can create new components using the following command:

```sh
nuxt-ui make component <name> [options]
```

Available options:

- `--primitive` Create a primitive component
- `--pro` Create a pro component
- `--prose` Create a prose component (requires `--pro`)
- `--content` Create a content component (requires `--pro`)
- `--template` Only generate specific template (available templates: `playground`, `docs`, `test`, `theme`, `component`)

Example:

```sh
# Create a basic component
nuxt-ui make component my-component

# Create a pro component
nuxt-ui make component page-section --pro

# Create a pro prose component
nuxt-ui make component heading --pro --prose

# Create a pro content component
nuxt-ui make component block --pro --content

# Generate only documentation template
nuxt-ui make component my-component --template=docs
```

::note
When creating a new component, the CLI will automatically generate all the necessary files like the component itself, theme, tests, and documentation.
::

### Locales

You can create new locales using the following command:

```sh
nuxt-ui make locale --code <code> --name <name>
```

## Submit a Pull Request (PR)

Before you start, check if there's an existing issue describing the problem or feature request you're working on. If there is, please leave a comment on the issue to let us know you're working on it.

If there isn't, open a new issue to discuss the problem or feature.

### Local Development

To begin local development, follow these steps:

::steps{level="4"}

#### Clone the `nuxt/ui` repository to your local machine

```sh
git clone -b v3 https://github.com/nuxt/ui.git
```

#### Enable [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack)

```sh
corepack enable
```

#### Install dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

#### Generate type stubs

```sh
pnpm run dev:prepare
```

#### Start development

- To work on the **documentation** located in the `docs` folder, run:

```sh
pnpm run docs
```

- To test the Nuxt components using the **playground**, run:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

- To test the Vue components using the **playground**, run:

```sh
pnpm run dev:vue
```

::note{to="#cli"}
If you're working on implementing a new component, check the **CLI** section to kickstart the process.

### IDE Setup

We recommend using VSCode alongside the [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). You can enable auto-fix and formatting when saving your code. Here's how:

```json
{
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": false,
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  }
}
```

::warning
Since ESLint is already configured to format the code, there's no need for duplicating functionality with **Prettier**. If you have it installed in your editor, we recommend disabling it to avoid conflicts.
::

### Linting

You can use the `lint` command to check for linting errors:

```sh
pnpm run lint # check for linting errors
pnpm run lint:fix # fix linting errors
```

### Type Checking

We use TypeScript for type checking. You can use the `typecheck` command to check for type errors:

```sh
pnpm run typecheck
```

### Testing

Before submitting a PR, ensure that you run the tests for both `nuxt` and `vue`:

```sh
pnpm run test # for Nuxt
pnpm run test:vue # for Vue
```

::tip
If you have to update the snapshots, press `u` when running the tests.
::

### Commit Conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages, which allows a changelog to be auto-generated based on the commits. Please read the [guide](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) through if you aren't familiar with it already.

- Use `fix` and `feat` for code changes that affect functionality or logic
- Use `docs` for documentation changes and `chore` for maintenance tasks

### Making a Pull Request

- Follow along the [instructions](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/blob/v3/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md?plain=1) provided when creating a PR

- Ensure your PR's title adheres to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) since it will be used once the code is merged.

- Multiple commits are fine; no need to rebase or force push. We'll use `Squash and Merge` when merging.

- Ensure `lint`, `typecheck` and `tests` work before submitting the PR. Avoid making unrelated changes.

We'll review it promptly. If assigned to a maintainer, they'll review it carefully. Ignore the red text; it's for tracking purposes.
